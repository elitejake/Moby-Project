## FAQ

#### Why does all of the Moby Project directories have `II` at the end?

This is the second version of the Moby Project. I have no idea where to find the first version or whether it is public domain or not.

#### What is the [`.untouched`](https://github.com/elitejake/Moby-Project/tree/main/.untouched) directory?

It contains the Moby Project files with their original filenames and **their original documentation**.
See the [`README.md`](https://github.com/elitejake/Moby-Project/blob/main/.untouched/README.md) file in the directory for more information.
