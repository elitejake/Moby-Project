# Moby Project

The **Moby Project** is a collection of public-domain lexical resources created by [Grady Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Ward).

*Not to be confused with [Docker's open-source collaborative project for the container ecosystem to assemble container-based systems](https://github.com/moby/moby).*

## FAQ

#### Why does all of the Moby Project directories have `II` in the end?

This is the second version of the Moby Project. I have no idea where to find the first version or whether it is public domain or not.

#### What is [`.untouched`](https://github.com/elitejake/Moby-Project/tree/main/.untouched) directory about?

It contains the Moby Project files with their original filenames with the original documentation.
See the [`README.md`](https://github.com/elitejake/Moby-Project/blob/main/.untouched/README.md) file in the directory. It also contains the download links for Moby Project files.
