(terminal sibilant varies)or
effect/n '/I/,f/E/kt  and  effect/v ,/I/'f/E/kt(stress varies)

information will terminate with the virgule (slash) in the vocabulary
field, followed by one ormore of the following part-of-speech
abbreviations:n, v, av, aj, interj, followed by the rest of the
pronunciation record.
