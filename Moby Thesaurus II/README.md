## Roget's Thesaurus-1911 ([`roget13a.txt`](https://github.com/elitejake/Moby-Project/blob/main/Moby%20Thesaurus%20II/roget13a.txt))
An electronic thesaurus derived from the version of Roget's Thesaurus published in 1911. This version also has addition of over 1,000 words not present in the original version, but many modern words are still missing. There are also many words which are foreign (primarily Latin) and many more, which are obsolete. According to it's documentation, even though this version has been proof-read, there are doubtless numerous residual transcription errors, some of which may be obvious even without reference to the original text.

See the introduction of [`roget13a.txt`](https://github.com/elitejake/Moby-Project/blob/main/Moby%20Thesaurus%20II/roget13a.txt) for instructions on how to use the thesaurus.
